### 🥽 “RealView” - VR Application for 3D Product Visualisation
RealView allows users to upload a 3D model of a product or environment and view it immediately in VR, 
either using a VR headset or a web browser. The use cases of such a tool are limitless, particularly in the fields such as product design, 
engineering, architecture, game development, or real-estate. It allows professionals to view or showcase their designs in a more immersive 
and interactive way, where products can be seen in real-life scale and interact with them (pan, zoom, etc.), achieving a simulation of tangibility, 
which can be achieved in a seamless way, replacing multiple steps that are currently necessary to achieve the same effect.
